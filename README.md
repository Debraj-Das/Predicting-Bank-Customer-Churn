## Predicting Bank Customer Churn: A Comprehensive Binary Classification Approach Using XGBoost

- Implemented Binary Classification Model for Bank Churn Prediction using a dataset of 165,000 samples.
- Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing: handled missing values, normalized data, and performed one-hot encoding.
- Engineered features such as Senior, Active_By_CreditCard, Products_By_Tenure, AgeCat, and Zero_Balance.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps.
  Identified insights from high-cardinality features like Surname.
- Developed custom outlier detection techniques to analyze outliers without removal.
  Trained and validated models including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost.
- Utilized Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation and achieved highest ROC AUC score of 0.8937 with Tuned XGBoost.
- Optimized model hyperparameters using Randomized Search CV, enhancing predictive accuracy.
- Generated detailed classification reports and confusion matrices for comprehensive model evaluation.
